# Data-Preprocessing-using-R
In this project we have to apply the pre-processing techniques in the given dataset to prepare the dataset for data analysis.

## Dataset
The following dataset contains statistics in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault and murder, in each of the 50 US states, in 1973. Also given is the percentage of the population living in urban areas. 

## Overview
In order to prepare a cleaned dataset, we need to perform the following tasks of data pre-processing using R language:
1. Data cleaning:
   * Smooth Noisy Data
   * Handling Missing Data
   * Data Wrangling or Munging
2. Data Integration
3. Data Reduction
4. Data Discretization

## Project Solution Design: 
Firstly, the data file was scanned and transformed into a csv(comma separated value) format. Then, Rstudio tool was used and the csv file was read and imported as a dataframe in Rstudio. Next, the data cleaning process started, first missing values were checked and we handled the missing values. Then we started to handle noisy data, we checked the outliers for different variables and handle the outliers with proper methods. Then we started data integration part and add a new column in the dataframe which contains value according to the given condition comparing other variable of the particular row. Lastly, data discretization was performed to categorized and understand the data easily.
